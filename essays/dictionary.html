<p>Making this dictionary is going to challenge me. I have all the content words in pu (+tonsi +soko) to define here. For some of these words, I’m not sure how I define them. This project is for two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having the dictionary I described in <a href="https://lipamanka.github.io/essays/semantic-spaces.html">my semantic spaces  essay</a> seems like it’ll be a really useful tool for toki ponists of many levels.</li>
<li>Making this dictionary will help me figure out how I define these words and how the community defines them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want this project to be useful and accessible, so I’m going to start it. I’m not sure if I’ll finish it, but I really hope I do, because I think it’ll be worthwhile. I’m going to start with just a couple of easier words, and as I add more this document will get longer. If you have any gripes or personal thoughts about any of these words that don’t reflect what I’ve written, please share them with me so we can start a conversation.</p>

    <h3 id="ilo">ilo</h3>
        <p>ilo contains things that are used towards a goal. It’s easy to say that everything can be used. Likewise if something is being used or can commonly be used, it is easy to call it an ilo. If I am using a hammer to hammer a nail into the wall, that is an ilo. If i am using a psychological method to calm myself down when i’m stressed, that can be an ilo as well. Without much context, ilo can refer to things that are commonly used as tools. With the context of it being used for something, though, anything can be an ilo.</p>
    <h3 id="palisa">palisa</h3>
        <p>palisa contains all objects that are not entirely flexible, and long. If I try to tie a stick into a knot, it will break. If I try to tie a subway pole into a knot, my arms will break. I think that a good way to check to see if the long object in question is a linja or a palisa is to see if you can tie it into a knot or not. if you can, it's a linja. if you can't, it's a palisa. Therefore, the thing that ties all palisa together is a mixture of being long and an inability to be tied into a knot as an intrinsic characteristic of the object. For more information, check out my entry on linja which isn't finished yet!</p>
    <h3 id="pimeja">pimeja</h3>
        <p>pimeja contians things that are a type of darkness. This could talk about specific colors like deep red or dark emerald green, but it can also talk about shadows, places where there is less light, or the absence of brighter colors. pimeja can describe anything that is dark. From some perspectives, the night is a type of darkness more than a period of time (just as a day can be a type of brightness and a year can be a type of circle).</p>
    <h3 id="utala">utala</h3>
        <p>utala contains conflicts and battles. When utala is used, it’s talking about some sort of struggle between two parties, or something being framed that way. So it could be a battle between two rival armies, but it could also be a battle between me and myself if I’m framing it that way. utala is often targeted, closer to “attack” than “battle.” Anything can be an utala if it is being framed as a struggle or attack of some sort that involves two parties. Playing a musical instrument could be an utala for a beginner player. Taking a test is a very fun thing to call an utala, because the test-taker is fighting the test.</p>
