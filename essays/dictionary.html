    <p>Above the dictionary itself, I will collect my thoughts about the project as it goes on.</p>
    <h3 id="pre-project-shpil">pre-project shpil</h3>
        <p>Making this dictionary is going to challenge me. I have all the content words in pu (+tonsi +soko +leko) to define here. For some of these words, I’m not sure how I define them. This project is for two things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Having the dictionary I described in <a href="https://lipamanka.github.io/essays/semantic-spaces.html">my semantic spaces  essay</a> seems like it’ll be a really useful tool for toki ponists of many levels.</li>
            <li>Making this dictionary will help me figure out how I define these words and how the community defines them.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I want this project to be useful and accessible, so I’m going to start it. I’m not sure if I’ll finish it, but I really hope I do, because I think it’ll be worthwhile. I’m going to start with just a couple of easier words, and as I add more this document will get longer. If you have any gripes or personal thoughts about any of these words that don’t reflect what I’ve written, please share them with me so we can start a conversation.</p>
    <h3 id="insights-a-few-days-in">Insights a Few Days in</h3>
        <p>As I’ve started writing entires, I’ve begun to realize something about the nature of toki pona words. Every word has some sort of innate quality or set of related innate qualities that describe/describes its entire semantic space. If an object has one of those qualities, it is considered part of that semantic space. If it has none of them, it is not. But this gives us power as speakers, and it’s a power that many proficient speakers already use. If we give anything one of the qualities of a word, it suddenly fits within that word’s semantic space. If I use my words to frame a lamp as a protrusion on a surface, I can call it a nena. If I use my words to frame a frisbee to be a bird, I can call it a waso. Of course, these things don’t normally fit into these semantic spaces, but they can if you frame them that way.</p>
        <p>I’ve found that what my project really is is to find those qualities I described above for each content word. This seems like it’s going to be significantly harder than I thought but it’s going to be worth it. Every entry I write will probably exist parallel to a community discussion, and I’ll have a lot of people to thank, but getting all their permission will be difficult so if you participated in one of these discussions, please let me know and I'll credit you.</p>

<h2 id="the-dictionary">The Dictionary</h2>
    <h3 id="ilo">ilo</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of ilo contains things that are used towards a goal. It’s easy to say that everything can be used. Likewise if something is being used or can commonly be used, it is easy to call it an ilo. If I am using a hammer to hammer a nail into the wall, that is an ilo. If i am using a psychological method to calm myself down when i’m stressed, that can be an ilo as well. Without much context, ilo can refer to things that are commonly used as tools. With the context of it being used for something, though, anything can be an ilo.</p>
    <h3 id="insa">insa</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of insa contains things that are inside of another thing. Commonly, this is used to describe a location. The location inside of a car is insa. It can also be used to describe objects that are inside of things. Someone's organs are insa. insa doesn't need to be contained completely, it can just mean "in between." A book in the middle of a bookshelf is insa. The space between two city buildings is insa. It can be used more abstractly too. When compared to a head, a mind is insa. In the context of good and bad, insa can be neutral. When compared to hot and cold, insa can be lukewarm. If anything is being framed as inside of  something else, it falls under the semantic space of insa.</p>
    <h3 id=kalama>kalama</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of kalama contains all noises and sounds and any act of creating a noise or sound. Any sound from any source can be a kalama. Music is a kalama. A scream is kalama. The sound that a tree makes when it falls in the forest is a kalama.</p> 
    <h3 id="ken">ken</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of ken contains abilities. These could be inherent abilities, like the ability to fly, walk, or swim. These could also be external, like permission to use the bathroom. If I can blow bubbles with bubble gum because I'm not around anyone who I don't want to annoy, that ability is a ken. Unlike some languages, toki pona has a single word that contains all abilities.</p>
    <h3 id="kili">kili</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of kili contains fruits and vegetables, i.e. any part of the plant that is edible. These could be fresh. An apple is kili. These could be fermented. Kimchi and pickled onions are kili. These could be preserved. Strawberry jam and dried mango are kili. kili can refer to wheat seeds or other grains that haven't been ground up yet, but flour and bread don't fit well into kili's semantic space and are better suited to be in pan's.</p>
    <h3 id="lili">lili</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of lili contains all qualities of smallness relative to context. The thing that ties all things lili together is their relative size. A tall man might be lili compared to a mountain. A long speech may be lili compared to a novel. lili is a relative word, and therefore is always dependant on context.</p>
    <h3 id="mije and meli">mije and meli</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of mije contains men and masculinity. The semantic space of meli contains women and femininity. These words are as well defined as the concepts they represent, so it's left intentionally broad without specifying further. This means that for beings that can talk to you, they decide if they fit within the semantic space of these words.</p>
    <h3 id="monsi">monsi</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of monsi contains things that are behind another thing or the back part of a thing. The caboose of a trains is monsi. The space behind a building is monsi. A person's back is monsi. monsi is relative, so its semantic space will always depend on what object it is in relation to.</p>
    <h3 id="nasa">nasa</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of nasa contains deviations from what's considered normal. If most people have blue hair and one person has green hair, that one person is nasa. If someone grows ten types of herbs and a single carnivorous plant, then that carnivorous plant is nasa. If most people don't grow herbs, someone who does grow herbs is nasa. What's considered "normal" here is completely reliant on context. A clown isn't "nasa" if everyone around them is also a clown. Nothing is inherently nasa. The nasa-ness of all objects will change along with context.</p>
    <h3 id="palisa">palisa</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of palisa contains things all things that are longer than they are wide that are not flexible enough to be bended significantly. any palisa will resist bending and either break or only bend slightly under significant pressure. If a palisa is looked at from a different perspective where there is enough power to bend it, it might be closer to a linja instead of a palisa. A good test that works most of the time is to check to see if it’s flexable enough to be bent into a 0 degree angle or if it’s flexable enough to be tied in a knot, if it is, then it’s probably not a palisa.</p>
    <h3 id="pimeja">pimeja</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of pimeja contians things that are a type of darkness. This could talk about specific colors like deep red or dark emerald green, but it can also talk about shadows, places where there is less light, or the absence of brighter colors. pimeja can describe anything that is dark. From some perspectives, the night is a type of darkness more than a period of time (just as a day can be a type of brightness and a year can be a type of circle).</p>
    <h3 id="sama">sama</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of sama contains all qualities of similarities and samenesses. Two siblings are sama because they have a parent in common. two stringed instruments are sama because they both have strings. Two action figures of the same exact character are sama.</p>
    <h3 id="telo">telo</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of telo includes liquids and other things that don’t hold a shape. Water, milk, and vinegar are telo. telo can be more viscous. Oils are telo. telo can be used less literally, to describe things that aren’t physical objects. The changing aspect of a way of speaking toki pona that doesn’t stay the same can be telo. If something changes form and doesn’t hold its shape, it fits within telo’s semantic space.</p>
    <h3 id="tomo">tomo</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of tomo contains objects meant to contain things being framed as living. Sometimes living is literal. A family of five is considered living, so their domicile can be considered a tomo. Sometimes living is a metaphor. A dollhouse can be considered a tomo if the hypothetical dolls it can contain are being framed as living, even if they aren't empirically alive. By calling a container intended for nonliving things a "tomo," a speaker is ascribing life to those objects. There's no animacy hierarchy in toki pona, so what is and isn't considered life is up to personal preference and doesn't impact mutual intelligibility.</p>
    <h3 id="utala">utala</h3>
        <p>The semantic space of utala contains conflicts, contests, and battles. When utala is used, it’s talking about some sort of struggle or competition between two or more parties, or something being framed that way. So it could be a battle between two rival armies, but it could also be a battle between me and myself if I’m framing it that way. utala is often targeted, closer to “attack” than “battle.” Anything can be an utala if it is being framed as a struggle or attack of some sort that involves two parties. Playing a musical instrument could be an utala for a beginner player. Taking a test is a very fun thing to call an utala, because the test-taker is fighting the test.</p>
