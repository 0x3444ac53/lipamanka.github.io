<h1 id="analysis">ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>I’ve come up for <strong>yiddish derived terms</strong> for content words and when they’re used, rigorously defined.</p>
<p>the first one is <strong>nokhesh</strong> (snake) and is when a word is used as the subject, direct object, or prepositional object.</p>
<p>the second one is <strong>kholem</strong> (dream) and is when a word is used after li or o, OR when it is the second word in the sentence and the first word is either mi or sina</p>
<p>the third one is <strong>sod</strong> (secret) and is when a word is used as ONLY the subject or direct object</p>
<p>the fourth one is <strong>emes</strong> (truth) and is when a word is used as ONLY the prepositional object</p>
<p>the fifth one is <strong>muvek</strong> (brilliant) and is when a word is modifying another word by going directly after it</p>
<p>particles are still called particles, prepositions are still called prepositions, preverbs are now called <strong>farkholem</strong> (before dream)</p>
<p>all of these terms are of hebrew origin to take away the one-up that german speakers have on non german speakers</p>
<p>That’s like it basically lol. idk how serious this is. I am not advocating for its usage, but pls use it lol that would be hilarious</p>
