<p>George Orwell wrote an essay called <em><a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/">Politics and the English Language</a>.</em> While I don’t agree with everything he says in it, I think one great point he makes is how a lack of shared definition can impair communication. His essay is mostly concerned with the applications of this issue as they relate to political writing, but I think this general idea can be applied to day-to-day communication. The most relevant section is his <em>meaningless words</em> section.</p>

      alt="kijetesantakalu"><em>Meaningless words</em>. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning[2]. Words like  <em>romantic</em>,  <em>plastic</em>,  <em>values</em>,  <em>human</em>,  <em>dead</em>,  <em>sentimental</em>,  <em>natural</em>,  <em>vitality</em>, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X’s work is its living quality’, while another writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X’s work is its peculiar deadness’, the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinion. If words like  <em>black</em> and  <em>white</em>  were involved, instead of the jargon words  <em>dead</em> and  <em>living</em>, he would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused. <mark>The word  <em>Fascism</em> has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’.</mark> The words  <em>democracy</em>,  <em>socialism</em>,  <em>freedom</em>,  <em>patriotic</em>,  <em>realistic</em>,  <em>justice</em>, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. <mark>In the case of a word like  <em>democracy</em>, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning.</mark> Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like  <em>Marshal Pétain was a true patriot</em>,  <em>The Soviet press is the freest in the world</em>,  <em>The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution</em>, are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are:  <em>class</em>,  <em>totalitarian</em>,  <em>science</em>,  <em>progressive</em>,  <em>reactionary</em>,  <em>bourgeois</em>,  <em>equality</em>.</p>

<p>I think that Orwell’s claims here are broadly applicable to most communication. I mentioned in my <a href="https://lipamanka.github.io/essays/descriptivism-in-toki-pona">essay about descriptivism</a> that the terms <code>prescriptivism</code> and <code>descriptivism</code> are often used as buzzwords, because when they’re used in a conversation, all parties may have different definitions of what they mean. What I didn’t talk about is how toki pona solves this problem!</p>
<p>Toki pona only has 120 words in its core vocabulary. Most of these words have agreed upon semantic spaces between speakers and can’t be used as buzzwords on their own. Additionally, even though it is possible to lexicalize in toki pona and many toki pona speakers do lexicalize, the majority of its speakers try to avoid it and it’s frowned upon.</p>
<p>Because of all of these factors, the problem of <em>meaningless words</em> is not present in toki pona.</p>
