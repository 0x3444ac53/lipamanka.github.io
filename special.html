  <h2 id="about">about me</h2>
    <p>I'm a tokiponist. I'm nonbinary (they/them) and aroace. I'm a college student majoring in linguistics. Things I enjoy: toki pona, linguistics, music, chilling, weasels (sometimes I like weasels way too much), cooking. Things I don't like: doxxing myself, loud noises, bigotry, paperwork. I have in the past worked in the board game industry. I'm available on discord (lipamanka#2222) and my email adress is simply my name (lipamanka) at gmail.com. </p>
    <p>We're kulupu poki, a system of about 36 members. We're a mixed origin system. Common fronters include lipamanka (they/them), Tim (they/them), wezzl (he/him) and Steven (he/him). Dispite being a system of mostly tokiponists, very few of us have toki pona names. Those of us who do have toki pona names don't have English names, most of the time! Some examples of headmates that break this trend are Hermes (kon wawa, he/him), Apollo (kon musi, he/him) and Ares (kon utala, they/them). Generally, <a href="https://lipamanka.github.io">https://lipamanka.github.io</a> doesn't have this blurb on it, but through the URL alone, by adding /secret to the end, you can access this extra version. If you did not know that we were plural, cool now you do, you can let us know or smth via discord or email or just not. I wouldn't say this is public knowledge outside of toki pona circles on discord, so don't go telling people, but if you found this version of my site by accident then cool. I might add additional essays here about plurality and my headmates might add their own stuff.</p>
    <p><a href="/essays/weasel">weasel essay</a> this is an essay that wezzl wrote about weasels that is accessible on this secret version of my site!</p>
    <p><a href="/essays/weasel-story">weasel story</a> hi, wezzl here! I wrote a story about a weasel and it's not very well written but I don't think that detracts from how good it is like as a story it's very entertaining in my opinion</p>

  <h2 id="thanks">thanks</h2>
