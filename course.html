      <h2>Click <a href="/course/tangets#pronounce-write-practice">here</a> to learn how to pronounce toki pona, write it, and where to practice. </h2>
      <h2>How do I use this course?</h2>
      <p>This course uses several unorthodox methods to teach toki pona. Understanding why is key to using this course. Here are the design goals for the course:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Words are taught in order of frequency!</strong> This means that after learning the first ten words, you can already understand a huge portion of the language, and provides the perfect foundation to learn the rest of the words <em>quickly.</em> While this is generally more effective for languages with quite a few more words than toki pona, it’s definitely a foolproof order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions begin with the etymology and function/meaning of the word in the language of origin.</strong> This helps strengthen vocabulary! In Māori culture, it is considered important to keep track of the history and origin of every word in the Māori language (include a source on this or remove it!). This is with good reason! Knowledge and wisdom of the origin of words can only strengthen a speaker’s ability to use language.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions are written in prose, describing the semantic spaces and/or function of each word.</strong> Click <a href="/course/tangents#semantic-spaces">here</a> to learn about semantic spaces, content words, and function words if this confuses you. Alternatively, read on and figure it out from context! I believe in you!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Where do toki pona words come from?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tok Pisin</strong> is an English based creole that serves as a lingua franca in the Malenesian country Papua New Guinea. I actually have a separate page about it on my website, so you can click there to be taken to said separate page (no link back to this one), but the jist of it is that almost all of the vocabulary comes from English, so it’s very easy to pick up for an English speaker. For that reason, whenever a word comes from Tok Pisin, this course may go into detail about how the word functions in Tok Pisin first before explaining how it functions in toki pona. It’s often nearly exactly the same! toki pona words of Tok Pisin origin tend to be function words, auxiliary verbs, prepositions and spacial words. Tok Pisin contributed the most out of any language to toki pona’s vocabulary, so there are also all sorts of other words that come from Tok Pisin.</p>

      <h2>Tips for using this course:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Skip ahead if you get bored!</strong> This course is built to go into detail, but it was also written by someone with ADHD and dyslexia who knows what it’s like to get bored quickly, and with that in mind, it’s also built to be skimmable. This is apparent in the layout, where important information is bolded and examples are given plenty of space. I encourage you to skip forward and back whenever you want! Have this course open in two tabs and switch back and forth. Go through it backwards for all I care. This course is a set of tools to help you learn without teaching yourself from scratch, so use it the way that works best for you!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Clikc on links to learn more!</strong> Even though this course is very detailed, it’s also meant to be focused. If you’d like to indulge my side tangents, I’ve catalogued them in a different page, and throughout this course there are many links to this page! Each link will take you to the section of the page that elaborates on the thing you want to learn more about. At the bottom of each such section is a link back to this document, specifically to the part of the page you just came from, so you can easily resume your learning. All of these links will be the word “here”, like this: “click <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a> to learn more!” or “You can learn more <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a>." You can click on one of these to test it out and come right back.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Don't worry if it doesn't seem like there's a way to say something yet!</strong> Trust me, I cover <em>everything</em> in this course. The unorthodox order of words means that some blanks won’t be filled in, but the sentences that you can start forming early on will provide such a strong structure to move forward and learn less common vocabulary.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Treat examples as exhaustive!</strong> Most possible constructions will show up at least once in an example, so if you’re confused, ctrl/cmd+F and search for a word and see if that usage comes up. If it doesn't don't use it, or ask for help!</p>
