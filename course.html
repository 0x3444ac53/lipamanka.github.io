      <h3>Click <a href="/course/tangents#pronounce-write-practice">here</a> to learn how to pronounce toki pona, write it, and where to practice. </h2>
      <h2>How do I use this course?</h2>
      <p>This course uses several unorthodox methods to teach toki pona. Understanding why is key to using this course. Here are the design goals for the course:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Words are taught in order of frequency!</strong> This means that after learning the first ten words, you can already understand a huge portion of the language, and provides the perfect foundation to learn the rest of the words <em>quickly.</em> While this is generally more effective for languages with quite a few more words than toki pona, it’s definitely a foolproof order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions begin with the etymology and function/meaning of the word in the language of origin.</strong> This helps strengthen vocabulary! In Māori culture, it is considered important to keep track of the history and origin of every word in the Māori language (include a source on this or remove it!). This is with good reason! Knowledge and wisdom of the origin of words can only strengthen a speaker’s ability to use language.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions are written in prose, describing the semantic spaces and/or function of each word.</strong> Click <a href="/course/tangents#semantic-spaces">here</a> to learn about semantic spaces, content words, and function words if this confuses you. Alternatively, read on and figure it out from context! I believe in you!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Where do toki pona words come from?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tok Pisin</strong> is an English based creole that serves as a lingua franca in the Malenesian country Papua New Guinea. I actually have a separate page about it on my website, so you can click there to be taken to said separate page (no link back to this one), but the jist of it is that almost all of the vocabulary comes from English, so it’s very easy to pick up for an English speaker. For that reason, whenever a word comes from Tok Pisin, this course may go into detail about how the word functions in Tok Pisin first before explaining how it functions in toki pona. It’s often nearly exactly the same! toki pona words of Tok Pisin origin tend to be function words, auxiliary verbs, prepositions and spacial words. Tok Pisin contributed the most out of any language to toki pona’s vocabulary, so there are also all sorts of other words that come from Tok Pisin.</p>

      <h2>Tips for using this course:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Skip ahead if you get bored!</strong> This course is built to go into detail, but it was also written by someone with ADHD and dyslexia who knows what it’s like to get bored quickly, and with that in mind, it’s also built to be skimmable. This is apparent in the layout, where important information is bolded and examples are given plenty of space. I encourage you to skip forward and back whenever you want! Have this course open in two tabs and switch back and forth. Go through it backwards for all I care. This course is a set of tools to help you learn without teaching yourself from scratch, so use it the way that works best for you!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Clikc on links to learn more!</strong> Even though this course is very detailed, it’s also meant to be focused. If you’d like to indulge my side tangents, I’ve catalogued them in a different page, and throughout this course there are many links to this page! Each link will take you to the section of the page that elaborates on the thing you want to learn more about. At the bottom of each such section is a link back to this document, specifically to the part of the page you just came from, so you can easily resume your learning. All of these links will be the word “here”, like this: “click <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a> to learn more!” or “You can learn more <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a>." You can click on one of these to test it out and come right back.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Don't worry if it doesn't seem like there's a way to say something yet!</strong> Trust me, I cover <em>everything</em> in this course. The unorthodox order of words means that some blanks won’t be filled in, but the sentences that you can start forming early on will provide such a strong structure to move forward and learn less common vocabulary.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Treat examples as exhaustive!</strong> Most possible constructions will show up at least once in an example, so if you’re confused, ctrl/cmd+F and search for a word and see if that usage comes up. If it doesn't don't use it, or ask for help!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h1>Lesson one: sentence structure</h1>
        <div>
          <p>let’s start with the most common word in toki pona conversation: mi.</p>
          <h2 id="mi">mi</h2>
            <div>
              <div class="etymology">
                <h3>etymology:</h3>
                <p>
                  mi comes from the tok pisin word “mi,” which originally comes from the english word “me.” It’s recognizable in most languages of Indo-European origin, as well as most creoles. It’s really easy to remember this one! “mi” is the first person singular pronoun in tok pisin, meaning that it can mean “me” or “I.”
                  <br>
                  In tok pisin, the language of origin, “mi” functions almost exactly the same as it does in toki pona. Let’s look at some examples of how it works in tok pisin: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi gutpela - I’m good
                    <br>
                    mi go - I’m going
                    <br>
                    mi wokman - I’m a worker
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Notice something about these sentences? That’s right, they all start with “mi!” Simply put a verb, adjective, or noun directly after “mi” and you have a sentence. <strong>Important: Because in both Tok Pisin and toki pona, verbs, nouns, and adjectives that all show up in the verb’s position, we will call that position “predicate” from now on to avoid confusion.</strong> Still confused? You can learn more about this term <a href="course/tangents#predicate">here</a>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Just like you'd do in its language of origin, simply juxtopose “mi” and any other content word (a word with meaning, i.e. an adjective, noun, or verb) and you’ve created a sentence! We’ll explore some examples of this once we build up a slightly larger vocabulary. With just this word, the amount of statements you can make is very low. In fact, I’ll list both of them. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi - me! (for example, if someone asks “who here is named Mako?” you may respond “mi!”) 
                    <br>
                    mi mi - I’m me, I am myself
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Note that toki pona words have no connotation of number. What does that mean? Well, to put it simply, “mi” can mean “we” as well, much unlike Tok Pisin! In fact, any set of objects that includes the speaker fits into the semantic space of “mi.” So the first of those examples could mean “us!” and the second could mean “We are ourselves.” 
                  <br>
                  Alright, now let’s learn about the second most common word: li 
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          <h2 id="li">li</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  li comes from several languages, but it’s likely a cognate in all of those languages. The most influential of those languages is tok pisin! (Stop me if you’re noticing a pattern.) This word is actually <em>the most common word</em> in tok pisin. It shows up an average of once per sentence. That means for every sentence in Tok Pisin without it, there’s a sentence with two. This word in Tok Pisin is “i,” likely from the English words “he” or “is.” The other possible words and languages of origin are Esperanto “li,” English “he,” and Latin “ille,” all of which mean “he” and are cognates.
                  <br>
                  Before I explain how “i” works in tok pisin, I need to teach you one more Tok Pisin word. I would tell you to forget it, but that will be very difficult, because it is identical to the English word. It’s called “yu,” and means “you.” Wow! Let’s see some example sentences with “yu” in it: 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    yu gutpela - You’re good 
                    <br>
                    yu go - You’re going
                    <br>
                    yu wokman - You’re a worker
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  :0 Oh my god! Look! It’s exactly the same as mi! Just put a word after yu to make it a sentence!
                  <br>
                  Now I’m simplifying a bit, but if the subject of a sentence is anything else except for “mi” or “yu,” you can’t just put a noun, adjective or verb after it to make a sentence (click <a href="tok-pisin-i-nuance">here</a> for more nuance). You need the function word “i.” Let’s look at some example sentences with the tok pisin word “em,” which is a general singular third person pronoun from the english words "them" or "him", used for both animate and inanimate things. 
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    em i gutpela - He’s good 
                    <br>
                    em i go - It’s going
                    <br>
                    em i wokman - She’s a worker
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>You can replace “em” with any noun phrase in tok pisin and it would still require an “i” before the verb. </p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>toki pona’s “li” works exactly the same. (Woah, deja vu! It’s almost like this stuff is easy!)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If a sentence’s subject is anything other than “mi” (or “sina,” toki pona’s second person pronoun, but more on that later), it <em>must</em> have “li” before the predicate. <em>X li Y - X does Y, X is Y, X has quality Y</em></li>
                  <li>li can be repeated multiple times for multiple predicates! <em>X li Y li Z - X does Y and does Z, X is Y and has quality Z, etc.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>With just “mi” and “li,” There are actually <strong>no further sentences you can construct in toki pona at all.</strong> By the end of this lesson, you will be able to create all sorts of sentences! But that may take some patience.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          <h2 id="e">e</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>This is one of the few toki pona words that Sonja Lang made up completely from scratch! It doesn’t have an origin! So let’s jump right into how the word works.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>“e” changes the meaning of predicates by marking an object. This is called <em>transitivity,</em> which you can learn more about <a href="course/tangents#transitivity">here</a>, but I’ll try my best to explain how “e” works without too much jargon. So what is an object?</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>An object is something an action is done to.</p></li>
                  <li><p>This is in contrast with a subject, which is something that does an action.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In order for there to be an object, there must be a subject.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Some sentences only have subjects with no object.</p></li>
                  <li><p>A subject performs some sort of action on an object.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Refer back to these rules as many times as you need.</p>
                <p>Things to know about e:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>e marks transitive objects. <em>X li Y e Z - X performs action Y on object Z</em></p></li>
                  <li><p>e can be used multiple times, marking multiple objects of the same verb. <em>A li B e C e D - A performs action B on C and on D</em></p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>As this course continues, you will see lots of examples that include “e,” but at the moment there do not exist any examples I can give you that don’t contain words I haven’t taught you yet! But that’s going to change soon! So don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense yet.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          <h2 id="ni">ni</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>ni comes from Cantonese 呢 (ni or nei, pronounced [nɛː˥] or [nei˥]). In Cantonese, this word can do more than one thing, but one of those functions is a demonstrative, which means it carries the meaning of “this.” (check with a cantonese speaker to learn more about this!!)</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>toki pona’s ni does a very similar thing thing to the words “this,” “that,” and “yonder” in English. In English, there is a three way proximity distinction. Depending on how close an object is to the speaker and the listener, a speaker of English will use different words to describe that object. (note: for most speakers of English, “yonder” has completely merged into “that.” This is not the case for me, and I’m not sure why.)</p>
                <h1>THIS ANNOYING HEADER STAYS HERE UNTIL YOU PUT THE FUCKING DIAGRAM OF THIS THAT YONDER</h1>
                <p>Unlike English, toki pona doesn’t have different words for these three different concepts. It uses one word for anything, no matter how close or far something may be. That means you won’t have to keep track of two or three words, only one!</p>
                <p>Let’s look at a couple of examples of sentences with “ni” in them using the words we’ve learned so far.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi ni - I do this, I am this
                    <br>
                    ni li mi - this is me
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Note how when ni is used as a predicate, it means “do this.” That’s because toki pona has no word for “do!” Click <a href="/course#ijo">here</a> to be taken down to the lesson in which this is elaborated on. Because of the nature of how predicates work in toki pona, there’s no difference between “I do this” and “I am this” in toki pona. As we move on, this will make more sense. </p>
                <p>summary:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>ni used as a noun refers to an object being pointed at or gestured at, just like the English words “this” “that” and “yonder.”</p></li>

          <h2 id="pona">pona</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>pona comes from the Esperanto word “bona,” which is an adjective meaning “good.”</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Because “pona” is in the name of the language, it is considered very important indeed. pona is, largely, any good quality. But to be more nuanced, pona is every good quality that makes toki pona as good as it is. The way that toki pona’s limited vocabulary can be freeing is pona. toki pona’s uniquely simple grammar is pona. You’ll see a lot of people claim that “pona” means “simple,” but this is misleading. In reality, things can be too simple, and if something is too simple, it isn’t pona. Likewise, if something is complex but not overly complex, it can be pona! To a toki ponist, the simple elements of toki pona are <em>probably</em> pona. In fact, pona’s semantic space very well describes all of the design goals of toki pona! “toki” means languages (sorry for the spoilers!), so “toki pona” is frequently just the language that is the most pona, which is toki pona; not because it’s the best, but because it fits perfectly with the semantic space of the word.</p>
                <p>pona is an adjective! That doesn’t mean it’s only ever used to modify nouns; quite the contrary. All that means is that when it is used in other positions, you can predict how its meaning changes! This is called “derivation” and is a very important concept in toki pona. These are very important rules:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>When an adjective is used as a transitive verb, it means “to make the object have quality A.”</strong> For example “pona” can mean “improve” or “fix” when used transitively.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>When an adjective is used as a noun, it means “that which has quality A” or “quality A.”</strong> For example, “pona” can mean “good thing” or “goodness” when used as a noun.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>let’s look at some example sentences. This is where we can really get creative! Now we have enough words to really do some damage.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi pona e ni - I fixed this (perhaps said while pointing to a repaired applience)
                    <br>
                    ni li pona - this is good (perhaps said while pointing to a beverage; or, gesturing to a situation, or in reference to something someone else said)
                    <br>
                    ni li pona e mi - this improves me (perhaps said while pointing at an erganomic computer mouse!) 
                    <br>
                    pona li pona - goodness is good
                    <br>
                    mi pona - I’m good 
                    <br>
                    ni li pona mi - this is my goodness
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Note that you can put a noun after a predicate to modify it, not before! You can actually do this to any content word in any position, as you’ll see in later examples. Here’s a new derivational rule:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>When a noun is used as a modifier, it means “of the noun” or “related to the noun.”</strong> For example, “mi” can mean “my” or “our” as an adjective.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note as well that both “ni” and “pona” are adjectives and can modify any content word in the same way.</p>

              <p>In this lesson, we learned a lot! We learned the five most common words in toki pona: mi, li, e, ni, and pona! We learned how to form sentences. But there’s a lot missing: the only things we can talk about are objects we can point at, good qualities, and ourselves. That’s less “the language of good” and more “the language of talking about how great I am.” In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to talk about:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>where, when, and in what contexts things happen</p></li>
                <li><p>talking and having conversations</p></li>
                <li><p><em>not</em> doing that??? and <em>not</em> doing things in general??</p></li>
                <li><p>asking and answering yes/no questions</p></li>

      <h1>Lesson two: What are we talking about?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Welcome back! Let's jump right back into the deep end.</p>
          <h2 id="la">la</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>la comes from, primarily, Acadian French, where it’s a suffix that marks proximal and topical information. What does that mean? I don’t know the specifics of it (note to self: ask Sonja Lang to explain how -la suffix works in Acadian French), but from what I can tell, it shows you information that is relevant in some way to what you’re saying.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>toki pona’s la helps bring relevant information to light. The best way to figure out how it works is with some illustrative examples.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi ni la mi pona - If I do that, I’ll be good. 
                    <br>
                    pona la mi ni - It’s good that I’m that. 
                    <br>
                    ni li pona e mi la mi pona - when this improves me, I’ll be good. 
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Notes on how la works:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>la goes between two statements</p></li>
                  <li><p>the second statement is usually a full sentence</p></li>
                  <li><p>the first statement is frequently either be a noun phrase of some sort or a full sentence</p></li>
                  <li><p>la says that in the context of the thing before it, the thing after it happens</p></li>
                  <li><p>this can work like "if, then" statements in English</p></li>
                  <li><p>this can work like "when X, Y" statements in English</p></li>
                  <li><p>this can work like "X, so Y" statements in English</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Look at the below diagram. In it, there are two circles. The larger circle is the context. It gives the background information. The smaller circle is the thing that’s happening. It happens <em>directly within</em> the context of said background information.</p>
                <h1>IF THERE IS NO FUCKING DIAGRAM HERE THEN THIS HEADING HAS TO STAY HERE IT'S SO UGLY OH MY GOD</h1>
                <p>More info on la:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>It’s common for two speakers to contribute to one instance of “X la Y.” The first person will say a sentence that they consider to be a statement on its own. Then, the second person will redefine that sentence as context for a new sentence by starting their sentence with “la.” The only difference between this and when a single person says “X la Y” is that more than one person is contributing to the same utterance.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Some speakers follow la with a noun phrase. For example, “mi ni la pona” - “If I do that, good (things will come).” Some speakers avoid this, but it’s widely used and understood, especially in active conversation.</p></li>
                  <li><p>you can use multiple la in a row! in “X la Y la Z,” X is the context for Y, and Y is the context for Z. You can do this as much as you want and most proficient speakers won’t get confused. It’s a great way to keep building off of previous ideas.</p></li>
                  <li><p>the thing before la can be longer than a sentence. in fact, everything that’s been said before la, everything that has ever happened before la, is context for whatever comes after la. Wether or not it’s one sentence or two never makes a difference in conversation.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In writing, toki pona speakers will frequently put commas before or after la. Wether it’s before or after doesn’t really matter too much. In Toki Pona: The Language Of Good, Sonja Lang consistantly puts commas before la. You’ll see speakers put commas after la more frequently though. Some people don’t use commas at all. I have done all three of these.</p></li>

            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>Have you ever screamed? Have you ever laughed? Have you ever been shocked and made a little noise? Have you ever been so relieved that you let out a sigh? Have you ever paused to think about what you wanted to say, holding an open vowel? Have you ever made an exclamation of excitement upon finally understanding something for the first time? “a” comes from all these things, in all languages.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>a has all of the meanings and usages of everything it comes from. It’s every paralinguistic noise you’ve ever made. It’s common to represent laughing with “a a a,” and I have friends who actually laugh like that while speaking toki pona (and friends that don’t). a is so common because people use it all the time.</p>
                <p>a can go anywhere in a sentence as well. Usually it doesn’t go in between a noun and a modifier, but it can. Here are some examples of how a would fit into various sentences in multiple places. Note that the literal meanings of the sentences are the same as if a wasn’t there, but they’re more emphatic, and there can sometimes be more emphasis in some places depending on where you put a.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    a mi ni - oh I’ll do that
                    <br>
                    mi ni a - I <em>do!</em>
                    <br>
                    mi la ni li pona a - In my opinion this is awesome!

                    mi la ni a li pona - In my opinion, <em>this</em> is awesome!

          <h2 id="toki">toki</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>toki comes from Tok Pisin “tok,” which means “language!” It can also mean conversation, talk, or even rumor or word. There are lots of words in tok pisin based off of tok, such as tokim, toktok, and tokples, but I won’t bore you with all the details.</p>
                <p>One interesting thing that Tok Pisin and toki pona have in common is that when you want to talk about a language, you put the name of the language after the word “tok” or one of its variants. For example, “Tok Inglis” for Engish. You would never refer to English on its own without that “Tok” there. toki pona works the same way! In order to talk about English, one may say “toki Inli.” The process on <em>how</em> we get from “English” to “Inli” can be a bit complicated, so you can clikc <a href="/course/tangents#tokiponization">here</a> to find out more.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>toki, at its heart, is a verb. In fact, it’s the first verb you’ve learned yet! Remember that that doesn’t mean it is only *used* as a verb, it just means that when it’s used as nouns or modifiers, we can predict very easily how that meaning changes! First, what is toki as a verb? It means “to talk,” or “to say,” or “to have a conversation” and the like. In toki pona, anything can talk. When you read a sign, perhaps it’s talking to you! When you look at plants, the way they transmit information to you could be described as “toki.” Let’s look at some examples of toki being used as a verb.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  mi toki e mi - I’m talking about myself
                  <br>
                  mi toki e pona - I’m talking about good things
                  <br>
                  mi toki pona - I’m speaking well, I’m speaking a language 
                  <br>
                  that is good, I’m speaking toki pona
                  <br>
                  mi toki Italijano - I’m speaking Italian (right now), I speak Italian (know how to)
                </blockquote>
                <p>Pretty simple! Note that there’s no built in way to talk <em>to</em> people, only to say things directly and talk about them. That’s okay! We’ll learn more about how to do that soon (click <a href="/course#tawa">here</a> to skip ahead to tawa).</p>
                <p>Now for a special usage of “ni!” ni is special because it can bridge the gap between sentences by letting you talk about other sentences. Look at the following examples:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi toki e ni: toki pona li pona a - I say this: toki pona is good!
                    <br> 
                    mi pona. mi toki e ni. - I’m good. I’ve said this. 
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In both of these examples, “ni” is standing in for a sentence. It’s very common to use ni like this, and it’s also very common to use a colon to indicate that if spoken, the speaker should use intonation to indicate that the ni is refering to the following sentence, not the previous one.</p>
                <p>Now let’s learn a new derivational pattern! What happens when we use a verb as a noun? <strong>When used as a noun, a verb takes on the meaning of that which it applies to.</strong> For example, when you talk, the thing that you talk is speech or language, so toki can mean speech, language, conversation, etc as a noun! It can also refer to things that are shared, like ideas and information, but by using toki to describe those things, you’re implying that they are communicated. Let’s see some examples.</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    toki Isisi li pona a - Yiddish is a cool language!
                    <br>
                    mi sona e toki ni - I understand that idea 
                    <br>
                    toki pona la mi pona - with toki pona, I’m skilled 
                  </p>

          <h2 id="ala">ala</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>etymology:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>ala comes from the georgian word არა (ara), which means “no” as an interjection and sometimes as a general negation particle.</p>
              </div>
              <h3>description of usage:</h3>
              <div>
                <p>ala is an adjective that negates whatever it modifies. Before I explain how this works and why ala is special, I must explain a general concept of how modification works in general. <strong>If you modify X with Y, the unit of X Y will always be a type of X.</strong> For example, a “toki pona” will always be a type of toki. a “toki ni” will always be a type of toki. <strong>The exception to this rule is ala.</strong> In fact, that’s all there is to it. If you modify X with ala, X ala is <em>never</em> a type of X. Let’s look at some examples:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi toki ala - I don’t talk
                    <br>
                    toki ala li pona - no languages are good
                    <br>
                    toki pona li pona e mi ala - toki pona improves something that isn’t me 
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>You can also use ala as a verb or a noun following the derivational rules from <strong>lesson one.</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi ala e ni - I erase this, I nullify this
                    <br>
                    ala li pona - nothing is good 
                    <br>
                    ala la mi toki pona - nothing can make me speak toki pona
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Let’s lighten the mood a bit. I promise more happy examples are to come! In the meantime, let’s talk about how <strong>ala can be used to mark yes/no questions</strong> (also called polar questions). The usage is simple. Repeat the predicate, and put ala in between the two instances of said predicate. Suddenly your statement becomes a question. </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    mi toki ala toki? - am I talking? 
                    <br>
                    ni li pona ala pona? - is this alright? 
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If you modify the predicate, I don’t recommend marking questions this way. Click <a href="/course/tangents#ala-qmarking-outside-of-pred">here</a> to learn more about how some speakers *do* mark questions this way anyway, though know it’s not common. It’s also uncommon and hard to understand if you use this question marking construction outside of the predicate (such as “ni ala ni li pona?” “Is *this* good?”). I don’t recommend doing that either, but you may see it in the wild. </p>
                <p>How do you answer yes/no questions in toki pona? The good news is that you don’t have to wait for a new word for yes. All of the content words in toki pona mean yes! Simply keep track of the predicate of the question sentence. To say yes, repeat the predicate. To say no, say “ala.” Simple!</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>

              <div>
                <p>lon comes from the Tok Pisin word “long,” the second most common word in all of Tok Pisin and one of only four pronouns in the language. To best teach the toki pona word, I’ll start by showing how the tok pisin word works! “long” is a basic all purpose preposition in Tok Pisin. It can refer to where something happens, where it comes from, and where it’s going. Let’s look at some examples:</p>
                <blockquote>

Anywhere in a sentence after the predicate (and if there’s an object, after the object as well), you can add a <em>prepositional phrase.</em> A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and its object. <strong>Note that there are two types of objects in toki pona: transitive objects, and prepositional objects. Don’t get them confused! “e” marks transitive objects, and all prepositions mark prepositional objects.</strong></p>

                <p>You can mix prepositional lon and content word lon too! Simply use lon as the predicate of a sentence while still using it to mark a prepositional object. Note that if the verb is lon, you will never need a second lon after it to mark a prepositional object.</p>
