      <h2>How do I use this course?</h2>
      <p>This course uses several unorthodox methods to teach toki pona. Understanding why is key to using this course. Here are the design goals for the course:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Words are taught in order of frequency!</strong> This means that after learning the first ten words, you can already understand a huge portion of the language, and provides the perfect foundation to learn the rest of the words <em>quickly.</em> While this is generally more effective for languages with quite a few more words than toki pona, it’s definitely a foolproof order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Definitions begin with the etymology and function/meaning of the word in the language of origin.</strong> This helps strengthen vocabulary! In Māori culture, it is considered important to keep track of the history and origin of every word in the Māori language (include a source on this or remove it!). This is with good reason! Knowledge and wisdom of the origin of words can only strengthen a speaker’s ability to use language. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Definitions are written in prose, describing the semantic spaces and/or function of each word.</strong> Click <a href="/course/tangents#semantic-spaces">here</a> to learn about semantic spaces, content words, and function words if this confuses you. Alternatively, read on and figure it out from context! I believe in you!
          </li>
        </ol>
