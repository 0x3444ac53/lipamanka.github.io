      <h3>Click <a href="/course/tangets#pronounce-write-practice">here</a> to learn how to pronounce toki pona, write it, and where to practice. </h2>
      <h2>How do I use this course?</h2>
      <p>This course uses several unorthodox methods to teach toki pona. Understanding why is key to using this course. Here are the design goals for the course:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Words are taught in order of frequency!</strong> This means that after learning the first ten words, you can already understand a huge portion of the language, and provides the perfect foundation to learn the rest of the words <em>quickly.</em> While this is generally more effective for languages with quite a few more words than toki pona, it’s definitely a foolproof order.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions begin with the etymology and function/meaning of the word in the language of origin.</strong> This helps strengthen vocabulary! In Māori culture, it is considered important to keep track of the history and origin of every word in the Māori language (include a source on this or remove it!). This is with good reason! Knowledge and wisdom of the origin of words can only strengthen a speaker’s ability to use language.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Definitions are written in prose, describing the semantic spaces and/or function of each word.</strong> Click <a href="/course/tangents#semantic-spaces">here</a> to learn about semantic spaces, content words, and function words if this confuses you. Alternatively, read on and figure it out from context! I believe in you!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h2>Where do toki pona words come from?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tok Pisin</strong> is an English based creole that serves as a lingua franca in the Malenesian country Papua New Guinea. I actually have a separate page about it on my website, so you can click there to be taken to said separate page (no link back to this one), but the jist of it is that almost all of the vocabulary comes from English, so it’s very easy to pick up for an English speaker. For that reason, whenever a word comes from Tok Pisin, this course may go into detail about how the word functions in Tok Pisin first before explaining how it functions in toki pona. It’s often nearly exactly the same! toki pona words of Tok Pisin origin tend to be function words, auxiliary verbs, prepositions and spacial words. Tok Pisin contributed the most out of any language to toki pona’s vocabulary, so there are also all sorts of other words that come from Tok Pisin.</p>

      <h2>Tips for using this course:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Skip ahead if you get bored!</strong> This course is built to go into detail, but it was also written by someone with ADHD and dyslexia who knows what it’s like to get bored quickly, and with that in mind, it’s also built to be skimmable. This is apparent in the layout, where important information is bolded and examples are given plenty of space. I encourage you to skip forward and back whenever you want! Have this course open in two tabs and switch back and forth. Go through it backwards for all I care. This course is a set of tools to help you learn without teaching yourself from scratch, so use it the way that works best for you!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Clikc on links to learn more!</strong> Even though this course is very detailed, it’s also meant to be focused. If you’d like to indulge my side tangents, I’ve catalogued them in a different page, and throughout this course there are many links to this page! Each link will take you to the section of the page that elaborates on the thing you want to learn more about. At the bottom of each such section is a link back to this document, specifically to the part of the page you just came from, so you can easily resume your learning. All of these links will be the word “here”, like this: “click <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a> to learn more!” or “You can learn more <a href="course/tangets#example">here</a>." You can click on one of these to test it out and come right back.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Don't worry if it doesn't seem like there's a way to say something yet!</strong> Trust me, I cover <em>everything</em> in this course. The unorthodox order of words means that some blanks won’t be filled in, but the sentences that you can start forming early on will provide such a strong structure to move forward and learn less common vocabulary.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Treat examples as exhaustive!</strong> Most possible constructions will show up at least once in an example, so if you’re confused, ctrl/cmd+F and search for a word and see if that usage comes up. If it doesn't don't use it, or ask for help!</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h1>Lesson one: sentence structure</h1>
        <p>let’s start with the most common word in toki pona conversation: mi.</p>
        <h2 id="mi">mi</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>etymology:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              mi comes from the tok pisin word “mi,” which originally comes from the english word “me.” It’s recognizable in most languages of Indo-European origin, as well as most creoles. It’s really easy to remember this one! “mi” is the first person singular pronoun in tok pisin, meaning that it can mean “me” or “I.”
              <br>
              In tok pisin, the language of origin, “mi” functions almost exactly the same as it does in toki pona. Let’s look at some examples of how it works in tok pisin: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                mi gutpela - I’m good
                <br>
                mi go - I’m going
                <br>
                mi wokman - I’m a worker
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Notice something about these sentences? That’s right, they all start with “mi!” Simply put a verb, adjective, or noun directly after “mi” and you have a sentence. <strong>Important: Because in both Tok Pisin and toki pona, verbs, nouns, and adjectives that all show up in the verb’s position, we will call that position “predicate” from now on to avoid confusion.</strong> Still confused? You can learn more about this term <a href="course/tangents#predicate">here</a>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>description of usage:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              toki pona’s “mi” works exactly the same way as tok pisin’s. Simply juxtopose “mi” and any other content word (a word with meaning, i.e. an adjective, noun, or verb) and you’ve created a sentence! We’ll explore some examples of this once we build up a slightly larger vocabulary. With just this word, the amount of statements you can make is very low. In fact, I’ll list both of them. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                mi - me! (for example, if someone asks “who here is named Mako?” you may respond “mi!”) 
                <br>
                mi mi - I’m me, I am myself
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Note that toki pona words have no connotation of number. What does that mean? Well, to put it simply, “mi” can mean “we” as well, much unlike Tok Pisin! In fact, any set of objects that includes the speaker fits into the semantic space of “mi.” So the first of those examples could mean “us!” and the second could mean “We are ourselves.” 
              <br>
              Alright, now let’s learn about the second most common word: li 
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="li">li</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>etymology:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              li comes from several languages, but it’s likely a cognate in all of those languages. The most influential of those languages is tok pisin! (Stop me if you’re noticing a pattern.) This word is actually <em>the most common word</em> in tok pisin. It shows up an average of once per sentence. That means for every sentence in Tok Pisin without it, there’s a sentence with two. This word in Tok Pisin is “i,” likely from the English words “he” or “is.” The other possible words and languages of origin are Esperanto “li,” English “he,” and Latin “ille,” all of which mean “he” and are cognates.
              <br>
              Before I explain how “i” works in tok pisin, I need to teach you one more Tok Pisin word. I would tell you to forget it, but that will be very difficult, because it is identical to the English word. It’s called “yu,” and means “you.” Wow! Let’s see some example sentences with “yu” in it: 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                yu gutpela - You’re good 
                <br>
                yu go - You’re going
                <br>
                yu wokman - You’re a worker
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              :0 Oh my god! Look! It’s exactly the same as mi! Just put a word after yu to make it a sentence!
              <br>
              Now I’m simplifying a bit, but if the subject of a sentence is anything else except for “mi” or “yu,” you can’t just put a noun, adjective or verb after it to make a sentence (click <a href="tok-pisin-i-nuance">here</a> for more nuance). You need the function word “i.” Let’s look at some example sentences with the tok pisin word “em,” which is a general singular third person pronoun from the english words "them" or "him", used for both animate and inanimate things. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                em i gutpela - He’s good 
                <br>
                em i go - It’s going
                <br>
                em i wokman - She’s a worker
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You can replace “em” with any noun phrase in tok pisin and it would still require an “i” before the verb. </p>
          </div>
          <h3>description of usage:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>toki pona’s “li” works exactly the same. (Woah, deja vu! It’s almost like this stuff is easy!)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If a sentence’s subject is anything other than “mi” (or “sina,” toki pona’s second person pronoun, but more on that later), it <em>must</em> have “li” before the predicate. <em>X li Y - X does Y, X is Y, X has quality Y</em></li>
              <li>li can be repeated multiple times for multiple predicates! <em>X li Y li Z - X does Y and does Z, X is Y and has quality Z, etc.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>With just “mi” and “li,” There are actually <strong>no further sentences you can construct in toki pona at all.</strong> By the end of this lesson, you will be able to create all sorts of sentences! But that may take some patience.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="e">e</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>etymology:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>This is one of the few toki pona words that Sonja Lang made up completely from scratch! It doesn’t have an origin! So let’s jump right into how the word works.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>description of usage:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>“e” changes the meaning of predicates by marking an object. This is called <em>transitivity,</em> which you can learn more about <a href="course/tangents#transitivity">here</a>, but I’ll try my best to explain how “e” works without too much jargon. So what is an object?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>An object is something an action is done to.</p></li>
              <li><p>This is in contrast with a subject, which is something that does an action.</p></li>
              <li><p>In order for there to be an object, there must be a subject.</p></li>
              <li><p>Some sentences only have subjects with no object.</p></li>
              <li><p>A subject performs some sort of action on an object.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refer back to these rules as many times as you need.</p>
            <p>Things to know about e:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>e marks transitive objects. <em>X li Y e Z - X performs action Y on object Z</em></p></li>
              <li><p>e can be used multiple times, marking multiple objects of the same verb. <em>A li B e C e D - A performs action B on C and on D</em></p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>As this course continues, you will see lots of examples that include “e,” but at the moment there do not exist any examples I can give you that don’t contain words I haven’t taught you yet! But that’s going to change soon! So don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense yet.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="ni">ni</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>etymology:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>ni comes from Cantonese 呢 (ni or nei, pronounced [nɛː˥] or [nei˥]). In Cantonese, this word can do more than one thing, but one of those functions is a demonstrative, which means it carries the meaning of “this.” (check with a cantonese speaker to learn more about this!!)</p>
          </div>
          <h3>description of usage:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>toki pona’s ni does a very similar thing thing to the words “this,” “that,” and “yonder” in English. In English, there is a three way proximity distinction. Depending on how close an object is to the speaker and the listener, a speaker of English will use different words to describe that object. (note: for most speakers of English, “yonder” has completely merged into “that.” This is not the case for me, and I’m not sure why.)</p>
            <h1>THIS ANNOYING HEADER STAYS HERE UNTIL YOU PUT THE FUCKING DIAGRAM OF THIS THAT YONDER</h1>
            <p>Unlike English, toki pona doesn’t have different words for these three different concepts. It uses one word for anything, no matter how close or far something may be. That means you won’t have to keep track of two or three words, only one!</p>
            <p>Let’s look at a couple of examples of sentences with “ni” in them using the words we’ve learned so far.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                mi ni - I do this, I am this
                <br>
                ni li mi - this is me
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Note how when ni is used as a predicate, it means “do this.” That’s because toki pona has no word for “do!” Click <a href="/course#ijo">here</a> to be taken down to the lesson in which this is elaborated on. Because of the nature of how predicates work in toki pona, there’s no difference between “I do this” and “I am this” in toki pona. As we move on, this will make more sense. </p>
            <p>summary:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>ni used as a noun refers to an object being pointed at or gestured at, just like the English words “this” “that” and “yonder.”</p></li>
              <li><p>ni can be used as a predicate to mean “do this” or “is this.”</p></li>
              <li><p>In the entry for the word “toki,” another usage of “ni” is described. Click <a href="/course#toki">here</a> to skip down to that.</p></li>

        </div>
        <h2 id="pona">pona</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>etymology:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>pona comes from the Esperanto word “bona,” which is an adjective meaning “good.”</p>
          </div>
          <h3>description of usage:</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Because “pona” is in the name of the language, it is considered very important indeed. pona is, largely, any good quality. But to be more nuanced, pona is every good quality that makes toki pona as good as it is. The way that toki pona’s limited vocabulary can be freeing is pona. toki pona’s uniquely simple grammar is pona. You’ll see a lot of people claim that “pona” means “simple,” but this is misleading. In reality, things can be too simple, and if something is too simple, it isn’t pona. Likewise, if something is complex but not overly complex, it can be pona! To a toki ponist, the simple elements of toki pona are <em>probably</em> pona. In fact, pona’s semantic space very well describes all of the design goals of toki pona! “toki” means languages (sorry for the spoilers!), so “toki pona” is frequently just the language that is the most pona, which is toki pona; not because it’s the best, but because it fits perfectly with the semantic space of the word.</p>
            <p>pona is an adjective! That doesn’t mean it’s only ever used to modify nouns; quite the contrary. All that means is that when it is used in other positions, you can predict how its meaning changes! This is called “derivation” and is a very important concept in toki pona. These are very important rules:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>When an adjective is used as a transitive verb, it means “to make the object have quality A.”</strong> For example “pona” can mean “improve” or “fix” when used transitively.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>When an adjective is used as a noun, it means “that which has quality A” or “quality A.”</strong> For example, “pona” can mean “good thing” or “goodness” when used as a noun.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>let’s look at some example sentences. This is where we can really get creative! Now we have enough words to really do some damage.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                mi pona e ni - I fixed this (perhaps said while pointing to a repaired applience)
                <br>
                ni li pona - this is good (perhaps said while pointing to a beverage; or, gesturing to a situation, or in reference to something someone else said)
                <br>
                ni li pona e mi - this improves me (perhaps said while pointing at an erganomic computer mouse!) 
                <br>
                pona li pona - goodness is good
                <br>
                mi pona - I’m good 
                <br>
                ni li pona mi - this is my goodness
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Note that you can put a noun after a predicate to modify it, not before! You can actually do this to any content word in any position, as you’ll see in later examples. Here’s a new derivational rule:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>When a noun is used as a modifier, it means “of the noun” or “related to the noun.”</strong> For example, “mi” can mean “my” or “our” as an adjective.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note as well that both “ni” and “pona” are adjectives and can modify any content word in the same way.</p>
