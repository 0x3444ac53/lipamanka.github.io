    <p>The idea behind this is that it'll be part of a course that is a modular set of laminated pieces of paper you can rearrange by hand. You WILL be able to buy physical versions of this laminated eventually! You will also be able to print it out yourself and either laminate or not laminate it, and it will be available online. Feel free to do what you want with it as long as you respect the liscence.</p>

    <p>Accessibility is importnant to me. I've uploaded SVGs to this site instead of images with text on them so that they're screen reader friendly. I hold myself to very high standards when it comes to the quality of these, so I will make sure that the order is right for all of them. If my site is inaccessible for any reason, please let me know and I'll do what I can to fix that! I will add a dark mode button (also for accessibility) at some point, but that isn't here yet :( sorry</p>

Special thanks also to <strong>jan Kekan San</strong> for letting me use his Dall-e 2 tokens to generate the image that I use for this site's metadata!</p>

<h2 id="statistics">statistics</h2>
    <p>This is where I collect my findings about toki ponists using the sona kulupu channel that I made in ma pona pi toki pona, or by speculating or estimating lol. When I say "toki ponists" in the following statistics, I am talking about the limited and biased sample size of people on ma pona pi toki pona. I'm not willing to go into more effort to make this data better though so enjoy some motherfucking statistics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>51/68 of toki ponists who have an opinion one way or the otherlike jeans</li>
      <li>there are a lot of trans toki ponists</li>
    </ol>
