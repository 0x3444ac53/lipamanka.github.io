<h1 id="part-one">Part One</h1>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
    <p>There are many times. There’s the beginning, which is impossible, because time goes in two directions. There’s the end, which is also impossible, because what is going on will never end. Some universes die, but new universes are born every moment from a churning whirlpool we only slightly understand, each universe existing with its own laws built on its own fundamentals. The heat death of your universe, dear reader, is like the death of a great tree. To a microbe that lives inside it, it might seem like the end of all, but to the forest, its death isn’t worth a second thought. If a tree falls in a forest, no god will care, and if a universe dies, reality won’t care either.</p>
    <p>There are many places, and space itself is hard to explain. Even within one universe, it can feel limitless, but if an inhabitant of a universe was able to leave one, its mind would break. The vastness of the places that are possible aren’t something it could comprehend. Reality is huge.</p>
    <p>This is a story of scale. It does start, and it might end, but it won’t start at the first place or time, and it won’t end at the last. In fact, the story will start in a very odd place.</p>
    <p>Your world, reader, is built on overlayed fabrics of three dimensions. They fluctuate, like lives and nations, and become energy, which is matter. Their laws are bound in such complex ways that humans have been trying to figure them out for millennia. Only a few of them consider that other worlds could be built on other things, and far fewer take that prospect seriously.</p>
    <p>The place this story begins in is one of those worlds. This world is built of a different type of fabric, a type of fabric that is more similar to a brain than anything else. In this world, a being’s mind isn’t a result of the matter it’s made of. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Matter itself is shaped around the mind, and beings are not bound by their minds. It is possible to change matter with thought in this world.</p>
    <p>It is possible for someone to move from one world to another. The most relevant person is a human from your world. He got transported to this one. When transportation like this happens, all aspects of a being are rewritten to better fit the new world they’ve entered, and for this man, that meant that his mind, a consequence of his biology, was the only thing that remained when he arrived. But because every mind shapes the matter around it, he was given a form.</p>
    <p>His mind was scared at first, so he was a timid mouse hiding beneath the pressure. He was overwhelmed with a grand confusion. Where was he? Why did he feel so weird? Soon, as his mind became calmer, he became a humanoid. His skin was light, and in the darkness, it almost seemed blue, like a dimmed fire on a gas stove, though it was hard to tell. He wore vermillion robes. His hair was a dark color, like the sea at night, and he found himself surrounded by stones of a similar color. A clocktower near the small graveyard he woke up in sounded four times, and judging by the color of the sky, it was four in the morning.</p>
    <p>Our story begins at this place, and at this time. Yarrow had arrived, and he found himself locking eyes with a hooded man, who was waiting for him.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-one">Chapter One</h2>
    <p>“Hello, Yarrow, I’ve been waiting here for you,” said the man.</p>
    <p>Yarrow was so confused he didn’t say anything. He didn’t usually experience dreams this vividly, but nothing felt real. His sense of what was real and what wasn’t was broken. It definitely felt like he was dreaming, at least a little.</p>
    <p>The man didn’t say anything else, but gestured over his shoulder for Yarrow to follow. Walking felt odd. It seemed like walking was more intentional than it had been before, and he couldn’t focus on it very well. “One foot after the other,” he muttered to himself. The man didn’t seem to hear, or if he did, he didn’t seems to care.</p>
    <p>He looked at his hands poke out under his oversized robes. They were tinted blue, which he didn’t really understand, but it felt right. He tried to remember what his body felt like before, but he was having trouble conceptualizing it. Trying to remember almost hurt, so he stopped trying for the time being.</p>
    <p>As they walked down the dim street, a cloud engulfed the moonlight, and a moment later it began to snow. Yarrow shivered and pulled his robe tighter, pulling the hood over his head. He was curious about how the weather changed so quickly, but he couldn’t find the motivation to speak.</p>
    <p>Soon, buildings began to touch more often, and poorly kept lawns grew smaller and neater until the disappeared entirely. It was hard to tell how long they had been walking. Time felt different to experience here.</p>
    <p>The mysterious man took a sharp left down a narrow alleyway. The walls were covered with layers graffiti written with runes Yarrow couldn’t read. The snow had hardly gotten in the ally. The man pulled a single loose key out of his pocket and unlocked a door with haste. “Quick.”</p>
    <p>Yarrow followed him inside. The man turned on a light and turned around to face Yarrow. “Welcome.” They were in a small hallway. There were four sets of shoes lined up against the right side of the wall, and there was a mirror on the left. Yarrow looked at his reflection. He wasn’t shocked by his light blue skin, but rather by the lack of shock over it - his skin felt right. His eyes were as blue as they had been before, but they looked bluer next to his skin and popped against his robes.</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” said Yarrow, finally. Speaking wasn’t how he imagined it before - his voice felt better than it in the past. It was almost euphoric. He felt calm for some reason. Whatever would have stopped him from following this man didn’t this time. “Why do you keep your key off a keychain?”</p>
    <p>The man responded. “I’m not sure. It’s the only key I need, and I haven’t lost it yet, but I do have friends with spares in case I ever lose it.”</p>
    <p>“Oh.” Yarrow followed as the man walked down the hall and into a larger room that seemed to be a general living space. There were a few stringed instruments hung up against the wall above a fireplace, and a few plants that were a deep earthy green, filled with life. There was a rocking chair and a more normal chair next to a table, and an L-shaped couch that faced a curtained window and a wooden coffee table. Yarrow clutched his robes tighter - it was getting warmer. “Sorry, I should have asked. What’s your name?”</p>
    <p>“Lamekh,” said the man, pushing his hood off. His hair was short and red. His face was boney and covered with freckles. “I’m glad you’re finally here.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” asked Yarrow, his vision blurring ever so slightly as he tried to listen.</p>
    <p>“It means I get to leave this city,” said Lamekh, throwing some logs of wood into the fireplace and finding a match. “I mean, it’s not the <em>worst</em> place to be, but I don’t like cities that much. Tried to make this little part of it my own though.” He smiled. He found a box of matches next to the fire and lit the fire. It started to grow.</p>
    <p>“Oh.” Yarrow peeled the curtain to the side and looked out the window. It faced a wall a few yards away with a lot of graffiti on it. “This is a nice spot, I guess.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” said Lamekh. “There’s history everywhere. Like some of the graffiti dates back to decades ago. And the library has a lot of resources about this area too. They have a catalogue of photographs.”</p>
    <p>“Mhm.” Yarrow spaced out for a moment. He was thinking about photographs. What were photographs again? He thought about pinhole cameras and film, and suddenly a more relevant thought popped into his head. “Wait, why were you waiting for me to leave? Couldn’t you have left already?”</p>
    <p>“Oh. Well, I guess I could have.” Lamekh thought for a moment, and then, quickly, “I knew you’d come here on a Wednesday at four in the morning, but I didn’t know <em>which</em> Wednesday, so for the past four years, I’ve gone there <em>every</em> Wednesday, and if I left the city, you wouldn’t have been found.” He paused to breath. “By me. Found by me. I mean I guess someone else might have found you, but then they wouldn’t have been me.” Lamekh knelt by the fire and poked it with a fire turner, letting the flames spill out onto some of the other logs.</p>
    <p>“How did you know when I’d show up? And my name. How did you know my name?”</p>
    <p>Lamekh stood up, still holding the fire poker and facing away from Yarrow. “I mean, it was four years ago. But in essence, I am privy to a lot of information that nobody else around here is privy to. Or, around anywhere, really. It’s just knowledge I have about certain things.”</p>
    <p>“That’s weird. Why?”</p>
    <p>“Magic, I guess? I’m not exactly sure how to explain. Like I know part of why but not enough to like, explain it. It’s like, someone gave the knowledge to me, but I’m not sure who, or how. But they’re very powerful and very cool, whoever they are.”</p>
    <p>Yarrow was silent again. He looked out the window again and watched the snow fall. “So is magic real here?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” said Lamekh. “It’s much weaker in the city, but yes, there’s lots of magic. Actually,” he said, letting the fire poker lean against the wall next to the fireplace, “hold on.” He knelt again and held his hands out over the fire. Yarrow watched. He breathed in and moved his hands upward, and the fire grew much larger and warmer. Then he breathed out and lowered his hands back towards the fire, and the fire returned to its previous state. Yarrow gazed at the fire, only half comprehending what was happening. “I’m not the best with fire, I guess, especially here, but that’s a good demonstration of magic, I guess. It’s just kinda a fact of life. I know you don’t understand what it is yet but other people might find that weird about you.”</p>
    <p>“Can I try?” asked Yarrow, almost unable to pull his eyes away from the fire.</p>
    <p>“Sure. I doubt you’ll be able to do it right away, though.” Lamekh moved to the side to make room for Yarrow.</p>
    <p>“Wait, why?” Yarrow switched his focus to Lamekh.</p>
    <p>“Oh. Uh,” Lamekh thought for a moment as Yarrow knelt by the fire. “A lot of kids learn how to use magic for certain things, kind of like musical instruments. But not all of them, by far, and usually when adults try to learn it, it takes them a very long time to get used to it. Not to mention the city -”</p>
    <p>“Oh yeah, it dampens the magic, right? Why?” Asked Yarrow, who was on his knees at Lamekh’s left.</p>
    <p>“Oh actually the full answer to that is very complicated, but I guess an easy way to explain it is that in a city, there are so many things that are made by humans, and away from cities, there are so many more things that weren’t made by humans, so the capability of a human’s magic here in the city is drawn into their surroundings.” He pulled the key out of his pocket with a sense of urgency. “If a human molds metal into a key, the key begins to sap that human’s magic very slightly. In a city, everything is made by humans. Well, except for maybe things like those plants.” Lamekh gestured to the fire. “Do you know how to get started?”</p>
    <p>“I assume I just move my hands like you did, right?”</p>
    <p>“I mean you can try that. I don’t think it will work.”</p>
    <p>Yarrow tried. When he breathed in, he moved his hands up in the same way Lamekh had, but the fire stayed mostly stagnant. It was very hard to tell if anything was because of Yarrow’s efforts instead of the natural flicker of a fire. He grunted.</p>
    <p>“Well, I mean we’re leaving the city tomorrow, and it’ll be way easier to try to do magic there.” Lamekh stood. “You can sleep in here, by the fire. I can just head to my bedroom or something.” He stood.</p>
    <p>“Okay,” said Yarrow, who was already not completely awake. He fell to the side and passed out almost immediately, his thoughts leaving him and thinning out.</p>
<h2 id="interlude-one">Interlude One</h2>
    <p>Science is an interesting concept.</p>
    <p>To humans, it’s a puzzle. They don’t actually have any control over how their worlds work most of the time. The laws of nature cannot be changed by those who are governed by them. Humans try to figure out the laws. They write about the implications of that. For humans, science is a method to figure out these laws so that they can manipulate them or take advantage of them. They use what they learn to build ships to ride the currents of time, but they are unable to change them.</p>
    <p>To gods, it’s a rulebook. The thing that humans call “science” is more of some code that a god put together. Gods can change the code, and they already know how it all works. Gods are terraformers, shaping the landscape and creating dams to hold the waters of time, digging irrigation lines to control its flow, and drinking it like a human scientist might drink coffee.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of gods, and their abilities are vast. They are seldom worshipped by their own names. In fact, their own names are not in a language. Rather, humans name nature and call it gods. But this isn’t different from science, because nature isn’t different from gods. Different cultures have different conceptions of what the gods are. They give them different names, divide them differently, and worship them in different ways. Some cultures worship one god while others worship a vast pantheon. Some cultures worship no gods.</p>
    <p>When a god notices that something very similar to themselves is being worshipped, they pay attention. Sometimes they use their power to bless those who worship them. Sometimes they don’t. It depends on the god and the worship. But the gods usually notice.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, gods speak to humans. There are a lot of humans, though, across the multiverse, so a single god is often spread thin between many people. So speaking to a god requires a level of dedication that not every worshipper is capable of. That being said, worship isn’t the only way to speak to a god, or to get one’s attention.</p>
