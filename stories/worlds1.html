<h2 id="chapter-one">Chapter one</h2>
    <p>There are many times. There’s the beginning, which is impossible, because time goes in two directions. There’s the end, which is also impossible, because what is going on will never end. Some universes die, but new universes are born every moment from a churning whirlpool we only slightly understand, each universe existing with its own laws built on its own fundamentals. The heat death of your universe, dear reader, is like the death of a great tree. To a microbe that lives inside it, it might seem like the end of all, but to the forest, its death isn’t worth a second thought. If a tree falls in a forest, no god will care, and if a universe dies, reality won’t care either.</p>
    <p>There are many places, and space itself is hard to explain. Even within one universe, it can feel limitless, but if an inhabitant of a universe was able to leave one, its mind would break. The vastness of the places that are possible aren’t something it could comprehend. Reality is huge.</p>
    <p>This is a story of scale. It does start, and it might end, but it won’t start at the first place or time, and it won’t end at the last. In fact, the story will start in a very odd place.</p>
    <p>Your world, reader, is built on overlayed fabrics of three dimensions. They fluctuate, like lives and nations, and become energy, which is matter. Their laws are bound in such complex ways that humans have been trying to figure them out for millennia. Only a few of them consider that other worlds could be built on other things, and far fewer take that prospect seriously.</p>
    <p>The place this story begins in is one of those worlds. This world is built of a different type of fabric, a type of fabric that is more similar to a brain than anything else. In this world, a being’s mind isn’t a result of the matter it’s made of. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Matter itself is shaped around the mind, and beings are not bound by their minds. It is possible to change matter with thought in this world.</p>
    <p>It is possible for someone to move from one world to another. The most relevant person is a human from your world. He got transported to this one. When transportation like this happens, all aspects of a being are rewritten to better fit the new world they’ve entered, and for this man, that meant that his mind, a consequence of his biology, was the only thing that remained when he arrived. But because every mind shapes the matter around it, he was given a form.</p>
    <p>His mind was scared at first, so he was a tome entombed in wood. Soon, his mind became calmer, and he became a humanoid. His skin was light, like a dimmed fire on a gas stove, and he was clothed in vermillion robes. His hair was a dark color, like the sea at night, and he found himself surrounded by graves of a similar color. A clocktower near the small graveyard he woke up in sounded four times, and judging by the dark sky, it was four in the morning.</p>
    <p>Our story begins at this place, and at this time. Yarrow had arrived, and he found himself locking eyes with a man of red hair, who was waiting for him.</p>
