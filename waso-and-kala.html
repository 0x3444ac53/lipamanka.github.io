<h1 id="my-usage-of-waso-and-kala-nasa">my usage of waso and kala (nasa!)</h1>
  <p>Before I begin and jump in with my hot takes, I’d like to clarify that my usage of waso and kala is, while in some ways close to common, not the most popular, and in some places is close to unique. Because of this I will start by describing the most common usage of waso, based on poll data from <em>ma pona pi toki pona.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></em></p>
  <p>Most commonly, waso is used by nearly every speaker to describe a flying bird. waso is often used by some speakers to describe flying vehicles or other things that are animate that fly of their own ability, and waso is also often used to describe flightless birds that vibe as closer to waso than other toki pona animal words. The usage of kala reflects this in my experience, but for fish instead of birds.</p>
  <p>In my usage of waso, a waso is anything in the air, in addition to its other meanings. If I throw a frisbee, it’s a waso. If I push a house off a mountain, it’s a waso. At least until it hits the ground.</p>
  <p>In my usage of kala, anything that’s in the water is a kala. When I take a shower or go swimming, I’m a kala. When I drop my book in the water, it’s a kala.</p>
  <p>In general I think this nasin is well understood and is very funny. It’s funny to point at my book sinking into the depths and say “hehe fish lmao.” This should be widely understood because it works well within context. I can’t say I recommend this nasin, simply because it isn’t common, and I recommend that learners try to use the most common nasins of toki pona. But this can be a fun deviation that doesn’t hinder communication.</p>
