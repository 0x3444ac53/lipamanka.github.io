<h1 id="what-is-tok-pisin">What is Tok Pisin?</h1>
    <p>Tok Pisin (lit "pidgin speak") is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is an English Based Creole. According to <em>Growing up with Tok Pisin by Geoff P Smith,</em> Tok Pisin originates from slaves in Australia and Samoa, two closeby oceanic areas. Slaves on plantations didn't have a language in common, so they used the framework of thier various indigenous languages and vocabulary from the English colonial presence to create a pidgin that would serve as a mother language to a dozen odd creoles in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Creolization is a process in which during language aquisition, the children of speakers of a pidgin consolidate and unify the pidgin into a creole. It's a very complex process that isn't well understood by linguists for a few key reasons. the first descriptions of most creoles in the pacific was done by missionaries, not linguists, who are very biased. This is the case with tok pisin. Additionally, creolization has only occured historically under unfathomably horrible human rights violations that are undeniably unethical.</p>
