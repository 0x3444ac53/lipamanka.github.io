<h3 id="who">Who is this page for?</h3>
    <p>Well, hopefully I can turn it in for one of my linguistics classes and get credit, but that's not why I made it. This is for people who want to learn Tok Pisin! I relentlessly tell everyone constantly to at least try it. might as well have a resource for it. My previous lexicography project was so successful I decided I'd try it with a different language! We shall see how it goes. Most of all, this page is for me. To pull up on my phone. It's nice keeping my notes on a website where the url is as simple as lipamanka dot gay forward slash tok dash pisin.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-tok-pisin">What is Tok Pisin?</h1>
    <p>Tok Pisin (lit "pidgin speak") is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea. It is an English Based Creole. According to <em>Growing up with Tok Pisin by Geoff P Smith,</em> Tok Pisin originates from slaves in Australia and Samoa, two closeby oceanic areas. Slaves on plantations didn't have a language in common, so they used the framework of thier various indigenous languages and vocabulary from the English colonial presence to create a pidgin that would serve as a mother language to a dozen odd creoles in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Creolization is a process in which during language aquisition, the children of speakers of a pidgin consolidate and unify the pidgin into a creole. It's a very complex process that isn't well understood by linguists for a few key reasons. the first descriptions of most creoles in the pacific was done by missionaries, not linguists, who are very biased. This is the case with tok pisin. Additionally, creolization has only occured historically under unfathomably horrible human rights violations that are undeniably unethical.</p>

    <p>Papua New Guinea (see below) is a country in Oceanea, and takes up about 1% of Earth's landmass. It's home to at least 4 million speakers, but all estimates of population have a wide margin of error and it's likely far higher. It is the most linguistically diverse country in the world by far, with over 850 separate languages (not dialects; <em>languages).</em> It's also one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse countries in the world, with a similar number of ethnic groups. This is because of The Highlands, which is the name of the mountain range that goes across the island. (It should be noted that Papua New Guinea is only the right half of the island New Guinea. This page discusses Papua New Guinea, but not the left half of New Guinea, which is part of indonesia.</p>

<h1 id="lexicon">What words are in tok pisin?</h1>
    <p>In this section, words will be presented in order of frequency. You may use command/control + F to search for english words. The dictionary entries follow my semantic spaces dictionary format for toki pona with a few adjustments: because idiomaticy in phrases is a thing in tok pisin (i.e. what words show up next to each other), I will be listing several idiomatic and consistent expressions with each word in its definition. This is a living document that serves as my notes for tok pisin. I will be taking notes directly into this document.</p>

    <p>This section will also contain function words and explain their syntax. If the syntax section becomes redundant, I'll remove it! Indeed, in a language like tok pisin, where all the syntax depends on which words are being used, syntax may very well be part of the lexicon. I'm not sure what the needs of this project are yet! I may delete paragraphs like this. CHAOS!!! yu mas wok yet long lukim long hia! (stay tuned!)</p>

    <p>AT THE MOMENT all of my data on the lexicon is in a google form. I will work on transferring it here! Once I have some data on here, I'll explain my methodology and sources for my data. For the time being, NO LEXICON FOR YOU! Sorry.</p>
